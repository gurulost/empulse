trying to seed data here, got some instructions, what should we do? I did it locally be we need it to be on the deployed site: 
  Commands to get everything “show-off ready”

  cd "/Users/davedixon/Downloads/empulse code"

  php artisan app:install --seed-if-empty --force
  php artisan demo:seed --import-instrument --employees=120 --months=6 --force
  npm run build

If you ran php artisan demo:seed ... on your Mac, it populated your local Postgres
    (DB_HOST=127.0.0.1), so only your local app sees that data.
  - For “anyone from anywhere” to log into the hosted site and see the full demo company
    data, you must run the demo seed on the hosted environment against its database
    (Replit/production Postgres).

  Run this on the server (Replit Shell / production console) in the deployed app
  directory:

  php artisan app:install --force
  php artisan demo:seed --import-instrument --employees=120 --months=6 --force

  After that, those logins (all password password) will exist in that server DB and will
  be shared for anyone who logs into that same deployed site:
  admin@workfit.com, manager@acme.com, chief@acme.com, lead@acme.com, employee1@acme.com,
  employee2@acme.com, employee3@acme.com.

• That output means: your local database (empulse_dev on 127.0.0.1) is now populated with
  the full Acme demo company + waves/responses, and those logins should work on your local
  app.

  For “anyone from anywhere” to see the same fully-populated data using those logins,
  they must be hitting a deployed site that’s connected to the same seeded database. If
  your public site is on Replit/Heroku/etc, you need to run the same seed there (in that
  environment’s shell) so it populates that Postgres:

  php artisan app:install --force
  php artisan demo:seed --import-instrument --employees=120 --months=6 --force

  Notes:

  - app:install --seed-if-empty said “Skipping seeders.” because your DB already had
    users; that’s expected and fine since demo:seed did the real demo population.
  - The Sass deprecation warnings during npm run build are not breaking errors; build
    succeeded.
